How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

	The staging area is different from the working area. The staging area is where you choose what to commit from your working directory into the repository. It's an intermediary step.

	There is value in this step because you might have work that  you are working on that you do not want to commit yet.
