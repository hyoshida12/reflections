When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?
  
  If you are working with a team, it is a lot easier to work together on that project.
  Even if you don't have access to your local machine, you can access repository from another.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your repository?

	The new update might have or might not have files that you need/were working on.
	There may be changes to files that affect your work.
	The auto pull might happen while you are working.
