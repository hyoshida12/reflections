When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?
  
  If you are working with a team, it is a lot easier to work together on that project.
  Even if you don't have access to your local machine, you can access repository from another.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your repository?

	The new update might have or might not have files that you need/were working on.
	There may be changes to files that affect your work.
	The auto pull might happen while you are working.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use the one instead of another?
	
	You would use a fork when there is a repository on GitHub that you want to copy, not onto your local, but on the GitHub server.
	You would use cloning when you want to copy a repository on GitHub onto your local.
	Branches are used when you are working on a project and you want to add new feature or test out something. 
	It will create a copy of the last commit and move the head there.
	Then you can choose to merge that branch with another branch and add/commit/push the changes to the remote repository.
